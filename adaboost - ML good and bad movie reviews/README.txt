I implemented the famous adaboost algorithm which turns a set of Weak Learners (which I also implemented) into one Strong Learner. 
This program learns bad and good reviews and constructs a classifier which can recieve an IMDB movie review and 
return, with high accuracy, whether the review is a good one or a bad one.
